Small Application to explore internal links of a website

crawler/ directory contains a python crawler based on scrapy which will output all links to links.json

frontend/ directory contains the frontend which is based on nuxtjs +  bootstrap-vue. It consumes the links.json and you can explore links via the frontend to sanitize all your internal links.

Software is written by me (Kemal) in 3 hours. Don't judge, rather pull request :)
